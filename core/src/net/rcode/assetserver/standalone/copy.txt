Usage: 
	assetserver cp [-options] serverroot to_directory
	assetserver cp [-options] serverroot from_path to_file
	assetserver cp [-options] serverroot from_path ... to_directory

Process and copy files from the given server locations to arbitrary locations
on the filesystem.  The goal of this command is to create a static snapshot
of a dynamic directory tree that would normally be processed on the fly
by making live http requests.  In this way, an entire tree of assets can
be snapshotted and hosted by a static webserver with no dynamic processing.

This command is intended to act similarly to the standard Unix cp command with
the following differences:
   1. If copying from a directory, then the copy is always done recursively
   2. If overwriting a file, it is deleted (unlinked) first, making it stable
      to copy directly over in-use files (at least on Unix-like systems)
   3. If an error is encountered during copy, the operation is aborted (can
      be changed with an option)

In all forms, the serverroot parameter must be the physical location on the
filesystem of the server root directory or .asconfig file.

For the first form, the entire contents of serverroot are copied to a given
target directory (which must already exist).

For the second form, a single named resource can be copied to a location on
the filesystem.  This form is activated if to_file is either a file or does
not exist.

The third form copies an arbitrary number of resources or directories to a
location on the filesystem.  In this case, to_directory must exist and be
a directory.  The basename of each from_path will be used to create a new
file or directory in to_directory unless if the from_path ends with a slash
(/), in which case, the contents of the resource directory will be copied
(this would be equivilent to naming each file and directory in from_path
on the command line).
