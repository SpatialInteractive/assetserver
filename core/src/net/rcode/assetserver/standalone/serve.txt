Starts an HTTP server to serve assets out of the given location.

If the location is a file, then it is interpreted as an asconfig.js,
which is responsible for setting up the server instance.

If the location names a directory, then one of the following actions
is performed:
    1. If the directory contains an asconfig.js file, then this file
       is interpreted to setup the instance.
    2. If no asconfig.js exists, then the directory is mounted in Simple
       Mode.  In Simple Mode, the named directory is mounted as the root
       and all defaults are applied.
       
Examples:
    assetserver serve a/directory
    assetserver serve directory/asconfig.js
    assetserver serve --http=8080 .
